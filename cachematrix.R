## Caching the Inverse of a Matrix:
## Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some 
## benefit to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than compute it repeatedly.
## Below are a pair of functions that are used to create a special object that 
## stores a matrix and caches its inverse.

## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse. 
## This function is created as part of week 3 exercise

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
        inver <- NULL
        set <- function(AB) {
                x <<- AB
                inver <<- NULL
        }
        get <- function() x
        setInverse <- function(inverse) inver <<- inverse
        getInverse <- function() inver
        list(set = set,
             get = get,
             setInverse = setInverse,
             getInverse = getInverse)
}
